**What's new in V3**
* Excube limit mode is added
* Fixed calculation mistake in code which was counting grinder bought per loop as 999 when in reality you only buy 990 grinder each time in the game
* Added excube used information to various status texts


**What's new in V2**
* Increased timings for all process (v1 has very tight timings and most of the people have errors because of that so the sleep timings between key inputs are increased all across the board, especially server actions)
* Added reload key (F6) which will reload the whole script. This is so that you can restart the program if something goes wrong immediately without having to run it again from explorer.
* Added stop selling button which will immediately stop the automatic selling process and reload the script
* Various modifications to enable/disable buttons according to what the user is doing currently.
